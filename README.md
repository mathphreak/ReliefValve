# ReliefValve
Prevents dangerous Steam buildups by letting you juggle games
between library locations.

# Usage
ReliefValve is entirely unusable right now, sorry.

Once that isn't the case, you'll need a working Internet connection because
I'm lazy.

# Stack
ReliefValve is built on Electron and uses the Noto Sans fonts from Google,
Yahoo's pure.css, and Font Awesome.

# Design
ReliefValve is designed to imitate the Pressure skin because it's the best.
